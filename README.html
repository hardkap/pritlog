<h1>PRITLOG - Think Simple</h1>
<hr>

<p>Pritlog is a simple, fatfree blog, made in PHP.</p>

<p>The idea of this blog, is directly taken from a very simple yet powerful blog software called PPLOG (Perl Powered Blog). PPLOG is a creation of Federico Ramírez (fedekun) - fedekiller@gmail.com.</p>

<p>I just wanted to experiment with creating a similar blog in PHP. Hence PRITLOG.

<h2>Thanks to</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ken, Bert, John, Andreas, Alexandre, Charles and few others for the testing, feedback and suggestions for developing this version.</li>
<li>Federico Ramírez, for the inspiration.</li>
<li>Barry K, the creator of Puppy Linux, for introducing me to PPLOG.</li>
<li>My wife, for the support and encouragement.</li>
<li>God, for enabling me to program.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes for Version 0.811</h2>
<ul>
<li>About block can now handle multi line data.</li>
<li>Deleting comment resulted in showing a page not found. This is fixed.</li>
<li>Page entries will not have option for comments. This will enable a CMS like operation.</li>
<li>The default login session timeout has been changed to never timeout. This can be changed in the admin panel.</li>
<li>Refreshing the page after submitting a comment or a new post was causing duplicate entries to be posted. This could lead to easy spamming. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Global privacy option has been added to control the privacy of the blog posts.</li>
<li>Draft option has been added to posts. Users can keep a post as draft and only they and the admin of the site will be able to see the post. </li>
</ul>


<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>If this is your first time installing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download the package and extract the contents to your hard disk.</li>
<li>Make sure you have a web hosting account with PHP.</li>
<li>Connect to your hosting account using an FTP client.</li>
<li>Create a folder on your website. (Example: "blog")</li>
<li>Change the permissions of this folder to 755. (In some cases 777 is required)</li>
<li>Upload the contents to this folder using the FTP client.</li>
<li>In your browser, go to the Pritlog url (Example: http://yoursite.com/blog/)</li>
<li>Visit the admin panel using the default login:<br> userid - 'admin' and password - 'password' and change this default password</li>
<li><strong>Start Pritlogging!</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Updating from an earlier version</h2>

<p>If you are on Pritlog 0.81, just overwrite all the files except your data folder ones.</p>
<p>If you are using Pritlog version earlier than 0.81, you will need to go through updating one version at a time until you are at 0.811.</p>

<br/>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3>1. Reset Admin Password</h3>
<p>If you lose or forget your main admin password, the only way to reset it is to manually edit the config_admin.php file and change the characters between the first and the second '|' character to <strong>a0c551398833948214f921e984868883</strong>. After you change this on your server, you can use 'password' to login to the admin menu. Now you can change the password as you wish.</p>
<h3>2. Sqlite not working</h3>
<p>Pritlog will run out of the box on most servers with PHP5. In some cases however, even though Sqlite is compiled into PHP5, the host may not have Sqlite enabled. </p>
<p>Pritlog already has code to try to dynamically load Sqlite module if not already loaded. But even this may not work on some servers</p>
<p>You can try this solution if you have access to php.ini on your server. All you have to do is to add the below lines to your php.ini (somewhere near other 'extension=' lines):
<br/><br/>; Loading PDO
<br/>extension=pdo.so
<br/>extension=pdo_sqlite.so
<br/>extension=sqlite.so
<br/>extension=pdo_mysql.so 
<br/>
<p>If the above solution does not work, try talking to your web hosting company to find out how to enable Sqlite.</p>

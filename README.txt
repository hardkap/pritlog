This is a simple blog, made in PHP

PRITLOG		                                              
                                                              
The idea of this blog, is directly taken from a very simple yet powerful blog software called PPLOG (Perl Powered Blog). PPLOG is a creation of Federico Ramírez (fedekun) - fedekiller@gmail.com.
                                                              
I just wanted to experiment with creating a similar blog in PHP. Hence PRITLOG.

    * Deleting entry - keeps the comments. This was a major bug that I had overlooked. Again, Eric (Caneri)'s testing revealed this error. We have real great testers and thinkers in the Puppy community.

This is a simple blog, made in PHP

PRITLOG		                                              
                                                              
The idea of this blog, is directly taken from a very simple yet powerful blog software called PPLOG (Perl Powered Blog). PPLOG is a creation of Federico Ramírez (fedekun) - fedekiller@gmail.com.
                                                              
I just wanted to experiment with creating a similar blog in PHP. Hence PRITLOG.		   Contact Me: prithish@hardkap.com

SIMPLE INSTALLATION:
====================
Upload all files to your server. Make sure the PHP file is executable by changing the permissions.

To configure it open index.php and edit the configuration options.
They are pretty self explainatory.

Enjoy!

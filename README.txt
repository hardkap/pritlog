This is a simple blog, made in PHP

PRITLOG		                                              
                                                              
The idea of this blog, is directly taken from a very simple yet powerful blog software called PPLOG (Perl Powered Blog). PPLOG is a creation of Federico Ramírez (fedekun) - fedekiller@gmail.com.
                                                              
I just wanted to experiment with creating a similar blog in PHP. Hence PRITLOG.

Changes for 0.411

Pritlog 0.411 (Fixes the following things - still in testing)

    * Category does not work when the category name has multiple words
    * Category is case sensitive now. This can be changed.
    * Let the post stay on screen, until it's successfully submitted!
    * Direct scrolling to the exact comment.
    * Catch comment users and other fields with just spaces. 




SIMPLE INSTALLATION:
====================
If this is your first time installing:

    * Download the package and extract the contents to your hard disk.
    * Make sure you have a web hosting account that has PHP enabled.
    * Open the config.php file and change settings as required.
    * Connect to your hosting account using an FTP client.
    * Create a folder on your website host called "blog" or whatever you want to call this new blog.
    * Change the permissions of this folder to 755.
    * Upload the contents (with the modified config.php) to this folder using the FTP client.
    * Now navigate to this location using your browser (Example: http://yoursite.com/blog/)
    * You are all set to test, blog and enjoy!

They are pretty self explainatory.

Enjoy!
